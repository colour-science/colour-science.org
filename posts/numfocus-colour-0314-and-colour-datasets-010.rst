.. TEASER_END

NumFOCUS
--------

**Colour** is now an affiliated project of `NumFOCUS <https://numfocus.org>`__,
a 501(c)(3) nonprofit in the United States. This will strengthen the project
and helps it grow and reach maturity.

and `Installation <https://www.colour-science.org/installation-guide>`__
guides.

Automatic Colour Conversion Graph
=================================

*Colour* now implements an automatic colour conversion graph based on
`NetworkX <https://networkx.github.io>`__ and enabling easier colour
conversions:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> sd = colour.COLOURCHECKERS_SDS["ColorChecker N Ohta"]["dark skin"]
    >>> convert(sd, "Spectral Distribution", "sRGB", verbose={"mode": "Short"})

::

    ===============================================================================
    *                                                                             *
    *   [ Conversion Path ]                                                       *
    *                                                                             *
    *   "sd_to_XYZ" --> "XYZ_to_sRGB"                                             *
    *                                                                             *
    ===============================================================================

Image Input and Output
======================

`Imageio <http://imageio.github.io>`__ is now a requirement for reading and
writing images, it will be used if `OpenImageIO <https://github.com/OpenImageIO/oiio>`__
is not available. If you wish to read *OpenEXR* files or develop *Colour*, you
will need to install the FreeImage plugin as follows:

.. code:: shell

    $ python -c "import imageio;imageio.plugins.freeimage.download()"

Support for `OpenImageIO 2.x <https://github.com/OpenImageIO/oiio/releases/tag/Release-2.0.3>`__
has also been implemented.

Name and Signature Changes
==========================

Various colour component transfer functions objects have been either renamed or
their signature changed, most notably the *sRGB* transfer functions and the
`colour.oetf <https://colour.readthedocs.io/en/develop/generated/colour.oetf.html#colour.oetf>`__
definition.

All the *reverse* words have been replaced with *inverse* in object names, file
names and, docstrings.

Coverage
========

Coverage was `raised to 100% <https://coveralls.io/github/colour-science/colour>`__.
It does not mean that all the possible code paths are covered but it certainly
strengthen the API.

Dependency Management
=====================

We have adopted `Poetry <https://poetry.eustace.io>`__ to manage the
development dependencies, the `setup.py` file has been replaced with a
`standardized <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518>`__ `pyproject.toml`
file.

Continuous Integration
======================

`Travis-ci <https://travis-ci.com>`__ and
`Azure Pipelines <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines>`__
have been replaced with `Github Actions <https://github.com/colour-science/colour/actions>`__.

Documentation
=============

The `README <https://github.com/colour-science/colour/blob/develop/README.rst>`__
and the `Manual <https://colour.readthedocs.io/en/develop>`__ have been
slightly reorganised to create a better separation between the tutorials, API
reference and, the new
`How-To Guide <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NRcdXSCshivkwoU2nieCvC3y14fx1X4X#offline=true&sandboxMode=true>`__.

Colour - Datasets
-----------------

`Colour - Datasets 0.1.0 <https://github.com/colour-science/colour-datasets/releases/tag/v0.1.0>`__
is a new `Python <https://www.python.org>`__ package dedicated to colour
science datasets management.

The existing datasets are hosted in
`Zenodo <https://zenodo.org>`__ under the
`Colour Science - Datasets <https://zenodo.org/communities/colour-science-datasets>`__
community:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import colour_datasets
    >>> print(colour_datasets.datasets())

**Colour - Datasets** was created to overcome issues encountered frequently
when trying to access or use colour science datasets:

-   No straightforward ingestion path for dataset content.
-   No simple loading mechanism for dataset content.
-   Unavailability of the dataset, e.g. download url is down, dataset content is passed directly from hand to hand.
-   No information regarding the definitive origination of the dataset.

**Colour - Datasets** offers all the above: it allows users to ingest and load
colour science datasets with a single function call. The datasets information
is hosted on `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org>`__ where the record for a dataset typically contain:

-   An urls.txt file describing the urls to source the dataset files from.
-   A copy of those files in the eventuality where the source files are not
    available or the content has changed without notice. This actually happened
    to the *Camera Spectral Sensitivity Database* dataset during the project
    incubation.
-   Information about the authors, content and licensing.

Other Projects
--------------
