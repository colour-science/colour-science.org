We are pleased to share with you our new logo and website!

.. TEASER_END

The new logo, less abstract than the previous, represents the light and its
`wave-particle duality <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality>`_:

The website is now powered by `Nikola <https://getnikola.com/>`_, a brilliant
static site generator.

It makes blogging with Jupyter Notebooks a breeze.
We also now have a proper dedicated `blog </blog>`_ section.

`Colour 0.3.7 <https://github.com/colour-science/colour/milestones/v0.3.7>`_
is around the corner. This is a maintenance release providing API support
for the soon to be deployed
`Colour - Demosaicing <https://github.com/colour-science/colour-demosaicing>`_
and
`Colour - HDRI <https://github.com/colour-science/colour-hdri>`_ repositories.
When they are officially released we will focus back on
`Colour <https://github.com/colour-science/colour>`_
itself as the next big step is the
`spectral code refactoring <https://github.com/colour-science/colour-ramblings/blob/master/spectral_signal.ipynb>`_
we started back in September.

Finally we have a work in progress toy project based on
`Vispy <https://github.com/vispy/vispy/>`_:
`Colour - Analysis <https://github.com/colour-science/colour-analysis>`_

It provides various image and RGB colourspace analysis features. A
`nasty issue <https://github.com/colour-science/colour-analysis/issues/1>`_
on Vispy side currently prevent us to release it but we keep an eye on it!
