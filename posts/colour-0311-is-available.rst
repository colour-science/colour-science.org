Colour 0.3.11
-------------

This was a release long in the making. It is an an important milestone on
`The Road to Stable <https://www.colour-science.org/posts/the-road-to-stable>`__ and
it introduces many new features, changes and fixes. The highlights of this
release are:

-   A new faster and more flexible spectral computations backend based on a
    continuous signal implementation.
-   A new documentation, rewritten with improved presentation and layout. The
    bibliography and cross-references have been fixed.
-   A deprecation system hinting the user on future API deprecations.
-   CAM16 colour appearance model from Li et al. (2017) with associated uniform
    colourspaces and colour differences.
-   A kernel interpolator that can use arbitrary user defined kernels.
-   Support for ITU-R BT.2100 transfer functions.
-   Support for SMPTE 240M transfer functions.

Please refer to the `releases page <https://github.com/colour-science/colour/releases/tag/v0.3.11>`__
for complete details.

Michael and I would like to thanks all the contributors and especially Nick Shaw
for his contributions to that release.
