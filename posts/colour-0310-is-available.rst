is available!

.. TEASER_END

The highlights of this release are:

-   Michaelis–Menten kinetics, a model of enzyme kinetics used by the new Fairchild and Wyble (2010) Lightness and Luminance computation definitions.
-   Implementation of ASTM D1925 and ASTM E313 yellowness computation. 
-   Support for ARIB STD-B67 (Hybrid Log-Gamma) OETF and EOTF. 
-   Support for DICOM - Grayscale Standard Display Function OETF and EOTF. 
-   Support for Protune Colourspace and Protune Log encoding and decoding curves.
-   Support for Prismatic colourspace.
-   Support for hdr-CIELab and hdr-IPT colourspaces.
-   Implementation of Meng, Simon and Hanika (2015) reflectance recovery.
-   Improved CIECAM02 implementation robustness with full round-trip capability.
-   Colour is now formatted using `Yapf <https://github.com/google/yapf>`__, the current configuration is subject to change but this will help contributors not using *PyCharm* to use their favourite editor while having the capability to format the contributed code to our *Colour* standard.

Please refer to the `releases page <https://github.com/colour-science/colour/releases/tag/v0.3.10>`__
for complete details.

Michael and I would like to thanks Katherine Crowson and Nick Shaw for their contributions to that release.
