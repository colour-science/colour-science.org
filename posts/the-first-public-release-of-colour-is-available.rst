We are thrilled to announce that after many months of work, the first public
release of `Colour <https://github.com/colour-science/colour/releases/tag/v0.3.0>`_
is available! Although this is an alpha release, the code is well tested and
covered and should be fairly stable.

You can view the highlights of the project on the `features </features>`_ page.

Please follow the `installation guide </installation-guide>`_ in order to
retrieve the code.

We have a few `IPython Notebooks <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/colour-science/colour-ipython/blob/master/notebooks/colour.ipynb>`_
already done to cover the theoretical aspect of the API.
