**Colour** started in 2013 as personal API shared with
`The Moving Picture Company <http://www.moving-picture.com>`__.

Generic objects have been extracted, reorganised and are now provided as a nice
packaged API while keeping the undisclosable code private.

`Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org>`__ implementation idea is coming from the
excellent `Mark Kness's ColorPy <http://markkness.net/colorpy/ColorPy.html>`__
Python package.
