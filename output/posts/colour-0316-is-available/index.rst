`Colour 0.3.16 <https://github.com/colour-science/colour/releases/tag/v0.3.16>`__
has finally been released!

.. TEASER_END

This release integrates all the `GSoC <https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/>`__
work from Pawel (`@enneract <https://github.com/enneract>`__), most of the code
from Nishant (`@njwardhan <https://github.com/njwardhan>`__) and, the
optimizations from Omar (`@OmarWagih1 <https://github.com/OmarWagih1>`__).
We would like to thank them again for their great contributions!

With this release, we stop testing for
`Python 3.5 <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-350/>`__ and,
`Scipy>=1.1.0 <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/release.1.1.0.html>`__
becomes the minimum version. This is also the **last feature release to
support** `Python 2.7 <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-270/>`__.
We will also trim the deprecation code in the next version thus, please make
sure to update your code accordingly.

Besides the various minor changes and fixes, the highlights of this release are:

-   Support for *Jakob and Hanika (2019)*, *Mallett and Yuksel (2019)* and,
    *Otsu, Yamamoto and Hachisuka (2018)* spectral upsampling methods thanks to
    Pawel's contributions as part of GSoC 2020.
-   Support for the computation of the *CIE 2017 Colour Fidelity Index* and
    *ANSI/IES TM-30-18 Colour Fidelity Index* colour quality metrics thanks to
    Pawel's contributions as part of GSoC 2020.
-   Support for generation of the *ANSI/IES TM-30-18 Colour Rendition Report*
    thanks to Pawel's contributions as part of GSoC 2020.
-   Improvements of the LUT IO support thanks to Nishant's contributions as
    part of GSoC 2020.
-   Performance improvements thanks to Omar's contributions as part of GSoC
    2020.
-   Support for *ACES Input Device Transform (IDT)* generation: The
    implementation follows to some extent
    `RAW to ACES v1 <https://github.com/ampas/rawtoaces>`__ and
    `P-2013-001 <https://www.dropbox.com/s/ouwnid1aevqti5d/P-2013-001.pdf?dl=0>`__
    procedure.
-   New *ISO* spectral datasets:

    -   ISO 6728 Standard Lens
    -   ISO 7589 Diffuser
    -   ISO 7589 Photographic Daylight
    -   ISO 7589 Sensitometric Daylight
    -   ISO 7589 Studio Tungsten
    -   ISO 7589 Sensitometric Studio Tungsten
    -   ISO 7589 Photoflood
    -   ISO 7589 Sensitometric Photoflood
    -   ISO 7589 Sensitometric Printer

-   Support for *IGPGTG* colourspace by *Hellwig and Fairchild (2020)*.
-   The `colour.SpectralDistribution.interpolate` and
    `colour.MultiSpectralDistributions.interpolate` methods now honour class
    instantiation time interpolation parameters instead of blindly applying
    *CIE 167:2005* recommendation, this introduces minor numerical changes.
-   Many definitions, methods and module attributes have been renamed to
    improve consistency and we are reaching a satisfactory point in that
    regard, hopefully, the names will be much more stable from now on.

for complete details.

Our other dependent Python packages have also been updated accordingly:

-   `Colour - HDRI - 0.1.8 <https://github.com/colour-science/colour-hdri/releases/tag/v0.1.8>`__
-   `Colour - Checker Detection - 0.1.2 <https://github.com/colour-science/colour-checker-detection/releases/tag/v0.1.2>`__
-   `Colour - Datasets - 0.1.1 <https://github.com/colour-science/colour-datasets/releases/tag/v0.1.1>`__

    - The following new datasets have been added:
