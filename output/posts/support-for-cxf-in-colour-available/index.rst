We are happy to announce the release of `Colour - CxF <https://github.com/colour-science/colour-cxf>`__.

This extension package for **Colour** implements reading and writing files in the `Color Exchange Format (CxF) <https://www.xrite.com/page/cxf-color-exchange-format>`__.

.. TEASER_END

What is CxF?
------------

**CxF** is a XML-based file format that provides a flexible way to store and exchange color data across different systems.
It supports multiple color formats including RGB, CIELab, and spectral measurements, while providing standard ways to
include metadata and descriptions about the color information.

Features
--------
The `Colour - CxF <https://github.com/colour-science/colour-cxf>`__ package allows

- Reading **CxF** documents from strings or files to a Python representation.
- Writing **CxF** documents from the Python representation to XML strings and files.
- Creating **CxF** objects programmatically for custom color data workflows.

Getting started
---------------

Install `Colour - CxF <https://github.com/colour-science/colour-cxf>`__ via `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip>`__:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install colour-cxf

or via `uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv>`__:

.. code-block:: bash

    uv add colour-cfx

Then use it to read **CxF** data:

.. code-block:: python

    import colour_cxf

    # Reading from a string
    xml_string = """
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <cc:CxF xmlns:cc="http://colorexchangeformat.com/CxF3-core" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
        <cc:FileInformation>
            <cc:Creator>Colour Developers</cc:Creator>
            <cc:Description>Simple CxF Example</cc:Description>
        </cc:FileInformation>
    </cc:CxF>
    """

    # Parse the XML string
    cxf = colour_cxf.read_cxf(xml_string.encode("utf-8"))

    # Access file information
    print(f"Creator: {cxf.file_information.creator}")
    print(f"Description: {cxf.file_information.description}")
