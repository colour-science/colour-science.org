Earlier this week, `Colour <https://github.com/colour-science/colour>`__
received its 1000th star ‚≠ê and we are proud of the achievement!

We would not be here without the help of our users, `sponsors <https://github.com/colour-science/colour/blob/develop/SPONSORS.rst>`__, `contributors <https://github.com/colour-science/colour/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTORS.rst>`__ and
`NumFOCUS <https://numfocus.org/>`__, so thank you all!

The development started six years ago, in April 2014 and today we reached an
important and exciting milestone.

    commit 90bc42b9fedfc7291c7023247eab14b41d5c29af

        Initial commit.

        Signed-off-by: Thomas Mansencal <***@***.com>

Colour science is often a topic that people avoid until they have no choice but
dive into it. As `I <https://github.com/KelSolaar>`__, was trying to address
the lack of quality HDR imagery for Image Based Lighting on the web, I quickly
fell into one of the deepest rabbit hole one could encounter. The truth is,
I'm still falling into it at light speed, and it is seemingly bottomless! :)

Michael joined shortly after, and from that point, the project started to take
off.

        Added new CAMs, tests for CAMs and fixed a bug in CIECAM02

Early, Michael and I created an invite only `Slack <https://colour-science.slack.com/>`__
workspace to coordinate the development. A year and half passed with mostly the
two of us working on **Colour**, at which point `Nick <https://github.com/nick-shaw/>`__
joined us along with `Kevin <https://github.com/KevinJW>`__:

More people from the VFX industry joined the Slack workspace, turning it into
a friendly virtual bar to talk about light, colour, rendering, and everything
around those topics. Many discussions not only contributed to shape Colour and
its dependent packages but they also rippled into other Open Source projects.

Six years cruising full steam, and we have some highlights the team has
accomplished to cherry-pick from:

-   Five actively maintained Python packages:

    -   `Colour <https://github.com/colour-science/colour>`__, 3350 commits
    -   `Colour - Datasets <https://github.com/colour-science/colour-datasets>`__, 120 commits
    -   `Colour - Demosaicing <https://github.com/colour-science/colour-demosaicing>`__, 220 commits
    -   `Colour - HDRI <https://github.com/colour-science/colour-hdri>`__, 380 commits
    -   `Colour - Checker Detection <https://github.com/colour-science/colour-checker-detection>`__, 100 commits

            Hey Thomas, Michael,

            Thanks for your work on Colour. It's fantastic, and has already helped us improve color correctness in our processing pipeline at YouTube (with more improvements coming soon, and hopefully fixes for open-source video pipelines too).

            If you're ever in SF, I'll buy you a round!

            Thanks,
            S***

will work toward dropping Python 3 support and walk the final steps for a 1.0.0
release!
