`Colour <https://github.com/colour-science/colour>`__ received its 1000th star

.. TEASER_END

The development started six years ago, in April 2014 and today we reached an
important and exciting milestone.

        Initial commit.

        Signed-off-by: Thomas Mansencal <***@***.com>

Colour science is often a topic that people avoid until they have no choice but
dive into it. As `I <https://github.com/KelSolaar>`__, was trying to address
the lack of quality HDR imagery for Image Based Lighting on the web, I quickly
fell into one of the deepest rabbit hole one could encounter. The truth is,
I'm still falling into it at light speed, and it is seemingly bottomless! :)

Michael joined shortly after, and from that point, the project started to take
off.

        Hey Thomas, Michael,

        Thanks for your work on Colour. It's fantastic, and has already helped us improve color correctness in our processing pipeline at YouTube (with more improvements coming soon, and hopefully fixes for open-source video pipelines too).

        If you're ever in SF, I'll buy you a round!

        Thanks,
        S***
